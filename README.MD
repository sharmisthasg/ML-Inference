Steps to create and run docker containers (ensure that the docker daemon is running):

1. Run the shell script `run_docker.sh` using the command `sh run_docker.sh`
2. Check if the server is running at `0.0.0.0:5000/` or `localhost:5000/`

Steps to check inference on images (once docker is running and previous step is executed):
1. Download the image to run inference on (eg. dog.jpg) in the `/images` directory
2. Run the command `curl http://localhost:5000/inference/dog.jpg` or any other image of your choice to get the prediction (class of object in the image)
